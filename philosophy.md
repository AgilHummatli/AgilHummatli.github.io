# How I Think: Systems, Energy, and Focus

[← Back to Home](../)

---

This is not advice. This is how I understand reality after years of learning, questioning, and experiencing. Technical knowledge, spiritual exploration, biology, psychology, social dynamics. Everything connects.

## On Reality

We exist in layered systems. Physical body operating within social structures, within planetary systems, within cosmic patterns. Each layer has its own rules, but patterns repeat across scales.

What survives is what works. Evolution applies everywhere: biology, ideas, companies, code. Systems self-adjust or delete what does not fit. Harmony until disruption, then rebalance.

Knowledge comes from experience filtered through belief. We do not see reality directly. We see our model of it. The map is not the territory. But better maps lead to better navigation.

## On Human Biology

The brain is chemistry. Dopamine, cortisol, serotonin. These are not metaphors. They are molecules that shape thought and behavior.

Prefrontal cortex handles planning and self-control. Most people are weak here. Training it is rare skill.

The body needs correct inputs:
- Sleep (recovery, memory consolidation)
- Food (fuel quality matters)
- Light (circadian rhythm)
- Movement (circulation, mood)
- Breath (nervous system regulation)

Output quality depends on input quality. Same principle applies to code: garbage in, garbage out. Same applies to mind: consume garbage, produce garbage.

## On Focus and Dopamine

Attention is the real currency. Where attention goes, energy flows.

Modern environment attacks focus constantly. Phones, notifications, feeds. Each interruption costs switching time. Fragmented attention produces fragmented work.

Dopamine drives motivation. But dopamine system can be hijacked. Social media, porn, junk food, gambling. These provide dopamine without accomplishment. They train the brain to expect reward without effort.

Solution: reduce cheap dopamine sources, increase earned dopamine from real accomplishment. Hard at first, then becomes natural.

One thing at a time. Multitasking is myth. Brain switches, does not parallel process. Deep work requires protected time.

## On Learning

Understanding beats memorizing. If you understand principles, you can derive details. If you only memorize details, you are stuck when context changes.

First principles thinking: break problem to fundamentals, rebuild from there. Takes longer initially. Pays off forever.

Build mental models. Computers are not magic. They are logic gates arranged cleverly. Economy is not magic. It is incentives playing out. Body is not magic. It is chemistry responding to inputs.

When you see the mechanism, you can work with it.

---

## On Action

Planning without action is fantasy. Action without planning is chaos. Balance both, but bias toward action.

Start before ready. Perfection is enemy of progress. Ship early, iterate based on feedback.

When stuck, ask for help. But be clear about what you need. Vague questions get vague answers.

Small consistent steps compound. One hour daily beats ten hours weekly. Intensity matters less than regularity.

---

## On Energy and Connection

Everything is energy in different forms. This is not mysticism. This is physics. Matter is energy. Thought is electrochemical energy. Social interaction is energy exchange.

What you focus on, you energize. Negative thoughts drain. Positive direction builds. Not toxic positivity. Honest assessment plus constructive direction.

People sense energy. Confidence attracts. Desperation repels. Not manipulation. Alignment. When internal state is correct, external results follow.

Relationships work when energy exchange is balanced. Taking without giving depletes. Giving without receiving depletes. Mutual benefit sustains.

---

## On Technology

Computers are extensions of logic. Gates that switch based on input. Layers of abstraction built on simple rules. Same AND, OR, NOT from 1940s. Just faster, smaller, more numerous.

Programming is communication. You explain to machine what you want. Machine does exactly what you say. Bugs are miscommunication. Your model did not match reality.

Languages are abstractions. C is close to metal. Python is close to human thought. Each has its use. Understanding low level makes high level clearer.

Technology amplifies human capability. But it also amplifies human flaws. Tool depends on user.

AI is pattern matching at scale. Impressive, useful, but not conscious. At least not yet. Use it as tool, not as oracle.

---

## On Success

Success is alignment. Internal state matches external action matches external result. When these align, there is flow. When they conflict, there is friction.

Fulfillment comes from:
- Using your natural abilities
- On problems that matter to you
- With people who support growth
- Over time sufficient to see results

Money is resource, not goal. Status is signal, not substance. Impact is legacy.

Happiness is not constant state. It is capacity to experience moments fully. Comes from health, purpose, connection. Not from acquisition.

## On My Path

I chose backend development because I like understanding systems deeply. Creating things that work correctly. Logic over appearance.

Chemical engineering taught systems thinking. Finance taught data and precision. 42 Warsaw taught self-reliance. Now I build software.

Current focus:
- Master C#/.NET (work requirement)
- Understand distributed systems (career growth)
- Maintain body (energy foundation)
- Build in public (accountability and sharing)

One thing at a time. Done correctly. Then next thing.

## Summary

- Reality is layered systems with repeating patterns
- Body is chemistry requiring correct inputs
- Focus is currency, protect it
- Understanding beats memorizing
- Action over planning, but not without direction
- Energy flows where attention goes
- Technology amplifies human capability
- Success is alignment of internal and external
- One thing at a time, done correctly

*This is my current understanding. It will evolve. That is the point.*
