## Key Principles

1. **Understand before memorizing.** Know why, not just how.
2. **One language deeply before others.** Fundamentals transfer.
3. **Build real projects.** Tutorials are not enough.
4. **Consistency over intensity.** 1 hour daily beats 10 hours weekend.
5. **Get help when stuck.** But be clear about what you need.
