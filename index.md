# Agil Hummatli

Backend Developer. Systems Thinker. Learning in Public.

I believe in understanding fundamentals before writing code. Computers are not magic. They are layers of abstraction built on simple logic gates. When you understand the full stack from electrons to software, everything else makes sense.

Currently working as Backend Developer at PASHA Insurance (C#/.NET). Previously trained at 42 Warsaw (C/C++), EPAM (Java), and completed CS50, Nand2Tetris, and various certifications.

## About Me

Chemical Engineer turned Software Developer. I took the long path: understanding how computers actually work before writing code for them.

My approach:
- First principles thinking
- Understand the "why" before the "how"
- Build mental models, not memorize syntax
- One thing at a time, done correctly

Currently based in Baku, Azerbaijan.
